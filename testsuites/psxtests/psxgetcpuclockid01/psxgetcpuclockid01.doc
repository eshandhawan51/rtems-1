test set name:  psxgetcpuclockid 1

Directives:
  Pthread_getcpuclockid()

Concepts:

+ This test exercises the getcpuclockid methods.

+ For pthread_getcpuclockid it created a pthread using pthread_create and
 then finds the clockid_t of that thread then used gettime() add a pause of .5 seconds
 and then ends the thread.
 After the thread is ended it again tried to find the clockid_t of the thread to 
 check for ESRCH exception.
